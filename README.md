# ShowMe (AppleScript)
An AppleScript application to show or hide 'hidden files' on macOS

Just download the .app file (technically it's a folder, but macOS sees it as a file)

I'm working on a version made using Swift [here](https://github.com/TheCoolBlackCat/ShowMe)

P.S. I'm no artist so please don't get caught up on the terrible icon.

P.P.S. Besides, you could always just use your own!
